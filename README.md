"# Movie_WebApp" 
A simple movie web app created using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)

Requirements:
- pandas == 1.4.2
- streamlit == 1.8.1
- seaborn == 0.11.2
- data: For movie datasets, you can download it from [The Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset). In this project, only 'movies_metadata.csv' and 'credits.csv' were used. (I want to upload the dataset but its size is too big).
